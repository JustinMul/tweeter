This project was created with the purpose of creating the front end of a twitter like app. 

The site was built to be responsive to the brower size of the user and updates in real time. 

The desktop site takes advantage of the larger screen real estate and displays more tweets.

Tweets can be added and upon hitting submit you will either see a tweet below or be greeted by an error message. 


The top menu bar will also scroll with you to allow for easy access at all times


Additionally as mentioned before if the user is on a smaller device they will be greeted by a different website view. The view can be seen below and aims to give the user a better experience.
